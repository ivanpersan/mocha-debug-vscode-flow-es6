# mocha-debug-vscode-flow-es6
JavaScript demo project for debugging Mocha tests with Visual Studio Code. The Javascript tested functions are implemented with ES6 and Flow. Simple and useful to learn how to configure Visual Studio Code launch file and necessary packages.

First, we should install npm dependencies and add babelrc file. Then, we configure launch.json with the specifications to execute Mocha tests (two definitions, all test or current file tests). After that, we can execute the configurations in Visual Studio Code Debug section, debugging and setting break points in our code as we want.
